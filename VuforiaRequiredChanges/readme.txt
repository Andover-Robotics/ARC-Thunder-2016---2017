These are the classes that need changes to. You probably won't be able to find them to well (actually just search "vuforia" 
and everything to do with it be highlighted), so just copy and replace the classes.

AndroidManifest.xml should be under ftc_app-master/TeamCode/src/main

FTCVuforia.java should be created in the folder ftc_app-master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/internal/testcode

FtcRobotControllerActivity.java should be in the folder ftc_app-master/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/internal

VuforiaTest.java should be created in the folder ftc_app-master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode
